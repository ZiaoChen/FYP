\section{Case Study: GoPubMed}
GoPudMed is a knowledge-based search engine for 14 million biomedical research abstracts in PubMed \cite{Delfs2005}, with the use of Gene Ontology (GO). According to \citet{Delfs2005}, it utilizes ontology-based keyword search and structures search results through categories of GO. Once GoPudMed receives user query, it submits the keywords to PubMed, extracts GO-terms from the retrieved abstracts, and presents the relevant sub-ontology for browsing. 

The GoPubMed approach for literature search has a few advantages, as noted in \cite{Delfs2005}. First, instead of pursuing only top hits, users are able to gain a high-level overview of the search results from the induced ontology. Second, the hierarchically ordered ontology allows for fast navigation of the search results from general to specific concepts. Third, the use of Gene Ontology enables one to derive general keywords relevant to the search although they may not be mentioned in the articles at all, as they are derived indirectly from the GO.
