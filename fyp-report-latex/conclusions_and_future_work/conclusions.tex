\section{Conclusions}
An information retrieval web application in the domain of digital signal processing was developed in this project. This IR application, named DSPLearn, is a proof-of-concept prototype for keyword search with concept ontology.

DSPLearn can serve as a framework for information retrieval with ontology in a specific domain. The technologies used in DSPLearn are generic and can in general be applied to any kind of text and any kind of knowledge bases. 

DSPLearn supports efficient search of PDF documents. It can generate a concept tree based on the search results for a query, from which users can filter the documents returned. It allows highlighting of terms that are mapped to user-selected concepts in a PDF document. The \textit{n}-th match approach was proposed for locating an exact term in a PDF document.

DSPLearn was built on some work done by other undergraduate students - including a RESTful back-end for retrieval of document data and a program for removing formulas in text.

DSPLearn was designed and implemented with re-usability in mind. It uses readily available up-to-date technology solutions for the development of mobile-friendly and responsive modern web application. The code is highly modular and achieves low coupling and high cohesion. DSPLearn is well documented so that future developers can easily take over and make it a ready-to-use product.
