\section{Aims and Objectives}
The aim of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept web application for search in the domain of digital signal processing with the use of concept ontology. This web application would serve as a framework for information retrieval with ontology so that it is readily usable for any other domains of discourse. The objectives for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To develop a web application that supports efficient search of PDF documents;
\item To generate a concept tree based on the search results for a user query, from which users can filter the documents returned;
\item To highlight terms that are mapped to user-selected concepts in a PDF document.
\end{enumerate}
