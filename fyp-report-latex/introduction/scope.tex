\section{Scope}
The domain for information retrieval is restricted to digital signal processing. However, it is possible to use the web application for other domains. 

The information retrieval system developed in this project is not a full-fledged product because ontology developing and concept recognition are not within the scope. However, the format for concept recognition output, i.e. term-to-concept mappings, is defined. A simplified ontology is also manually crafted for demonstration purpose.
