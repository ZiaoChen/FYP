This Final Year Project (FYP) was made possible thanks to the cooperation and support of the following people, who have helped me gain much more than what was expected. I am grateful and thankful to them.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Assoc Prof Chng Eng Siong, my FYP supervisor, for his valuable advice and guidance throughout the project.

I also wish to thank Mr.~Kyaw Zin Tun, a project officer from Rolls-Royce@NTU Corporate Lab, for his feedback and assistance during software development.

Finally, I wish to express my appreciation to the two undergraduate students, Sun Ximeng and Wu Zhenghao, for their work on the text retrieval project. The web application developed would not be complete without the work they have done.
